1) To tackle the challenge of reading a CSV file with data that includes both values and formulas, I  would use a combination of the following steps: 
Read the CSV file using a library such as pandas or csv 
Iterate through each cell in the file, and for each cell that is a formula, use a library such as python expr or eval() to evaluate the formula and replace the formula with its calculated value 
Write the modified data to a new CSV file 
2) Some types of errors that I would check for include: 
Incorrectly formatted formulas (e.g. missing operators or parentheses) 
Reference to non-existent cells in formulas 
Incorrectly formatted CSV file (e.g. missing or extra commas) 
Issues with reading or writing the CSV file (e.g. file not found or permission denied)
3) A user could break the code by: 
Providing a CSV file with a format that is not expected or supported 
Providing formulas that reference cells that are not present in the file 
Providing formulas that contain malicious code (e.g. code that deletes files or sends data to external  servers) 
Providing a CSV file with a very large number of formulas or cells, causing the program to run out of  memory or take a long time to execute.
