A user could break the code by:
Providing a CSV file with a format that is not expected or supported
Providing formulas that reference cells that are not present in the file
Providing formulas that contain malicious code (e.g. code that deletes files or sends data to external
servers)
Providing a CSV file with a very large number of formulas or cells, causing the program to run out of
memory or take a long time to execute.
